1. Change all Text files (aka. CNS and Def) to UTF-8 format. Notepad++ is recommend for this task. First Open a file them select "Encoding" - Character sets - Japanese - Shift-JIS, next you'll able to see the Japanese comments. them "Encoding" Convert to UTF-8.

2. Add "localcoord = 320,240" at the [Info] section of the Def file.

3. Change the "mugenversion =" to 1.0 at the [Info] section of the Def file.

4. Open [name].cns change [Size] section as follow.

xscale           = 0.78     ;キャラ画像の横のスケール
yscale           = 1	    ;キャラ画像の縦のスケール


5. Open "system_direction.cns" find "[State ＳＡゲージｙ軸];数値を小さくするとゲージは上の方へ移動します"
look at the value and change the "225" to "Ceil(GameHeight)-8"


6. Open [name.cns] search "pos = 80,200" and replace all with "pos = 80,Helper(30000),Var(17) - 12"
Caution: sometime it's not Helper(30000). you need to make sure the 1st line of "system_direction.cns" the Statedef Number should be the Same No. of helper Number.


7. Open [name.cmd] and you will see some command definition like name = "AI_1" name = "AI_2".... delete them all
them search "[State -1, AI]" with a lots off triggers change the whole section like this (Caution Helper nunber may different)

[State -1, AI]
type = varset
triggerall = numhelper(30000)
triggerall = helper(30000),var(15) = 1
trigger1 = AILevel && Var(50) != 1
trigger2 = !AILevel && Var(50) = 1
v = 50
value = Ifelse(AILevel,1,0)

8. Open "common.cns" search statedef 5900 and add insert follow line above the 2 changesatates contorller.
[State 5900, win quote normal]
type= VictoryQuote
trigger1 = !time
value= random%8 + 1					;Change the %8 to %9 if you have 9 Quotes
persistent=0


9. Open "name.cns" search for "statedef 100" them add these quotes above the Statedef 100 section
you can also add Japanese sentenses to the Jp.Quotes and it will be displayed if you change your mugen language to jpanese in mugen.cfg. but the English is a Must have.

10. Use Notepad++ and use Search - Find in files to seach and add "ignorehitpause = 1" at the button of the each controller of AssertSpecial, AngleDraw PlayerPush,Offset,ScreenBound, Trans, and Width

search every Hitdef Controller in your character
find something like these

pausetime= 10,10
guard.pausetime = 10,10

and add 1 on P2
like these

pausetime= 10,11
