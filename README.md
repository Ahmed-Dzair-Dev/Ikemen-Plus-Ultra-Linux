project is under construction.

Ikemen Plus Ultra is an updated version of the OLD Ikemen Plus. The engine was made by Suehiro under S-SIZE Project, improved by K4thos and currently developing by CD2, Strong FS and some features developed by PlasmoidThunder.

## TODO List

**Ahmed:** Plans for future updates.

**find alternative of " Visual C++ 2010 Express " for linux**
------------

- i will use a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on linux
like ( wine or proton ) ðŸš«

- masetring Cmake ðŸš«

or

- i will just install windows 7 ðŸš«

- Asking Help from AI âœ…

- converting those .vcxproj to CMakeLists.txt âœ…

------------


**A working linux excutable** âœ…

------------

- find linux alternatives for the unsupported or not working libs ( because " IPU " is a windows project )

" compile the rest of the game engine libs to linux "

the dll folder :

ssz.dll its now libssz.so âœ…

file.dll its now libfile.so âœ…

alert.dll its now libalert.so âœ…

shell.dll its now libshell.so âœ…

time.dll its now libtime.so âœ…

math.dll its now libmath.so âœ…

regex.dll its now libregex.so âœ…

socket.dll its now libsocket.so âœ…

sound.dll its now libsound.so âœ…

thread.dll its now libthread.so âœ…

the alpha folder :

lua.dll to liblua.so âœ…

( still working in progress )


- Remplace DirectX with OpenDX or DXVK 

or

- For a general approach to replacing DirectX in the game engine :

Replace DirectX rendering calls with SDL2 rendering

Use SDL2 for window creation and input handling

Use OpenGL for graphics rendering

Ensure Lua scripting remains compatible

- fix bugs

------------

**Add more features**

- Network Play without using Radmin VPN. 

- I will try to find an open source alternative of that program to fuse it with the engine.

- Focusing on performance .

( OpenGl is not friendly with all potato computers. so my interest is on that native directx for linux )

- add more languages like ( arabic , japanese , chinese , "french ?" )

- a char detector ( when the player or the devloper put a new char folder or char.zip " before opening the engine " the engine detects that and it will notfiy us to accept to put the char or not )

------------


i think that it.
