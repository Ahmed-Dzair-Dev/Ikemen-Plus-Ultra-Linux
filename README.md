## TODO List

**Ahmed:** Plans for future updates.

**find alternative of " Visual C++ 2010 Express " for linux**
------------

- i will use a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on linux
like ( wine or proton )

or

- i will just install windows 7

------------


**A working linux excutable**

------------

- find linux alternatives for the unsupported or not working libs ( because " IPU " is a windows project )

- Remplace DirectX with OpenDX

- fix bugs

------------

**Add more features**

- Network Play without using Radmin VPN. 

- I will try to find an open source alternative of that program to fuse it with the engine.

- Focusing on performance .

( OpenGl is not friendly with all potato computers. so my interest is on that native directx for linux )

- add more languages like ( arabic , japanese , chinese , "french ?" )

- a char detector ( when the player or the devloper put a new char folder or char.zip " before opening the engine " the engine detects that and it will notfiy us to accept to put the char or not )

------------


i think that it.
