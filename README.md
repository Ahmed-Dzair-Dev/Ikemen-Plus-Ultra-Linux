project is under construction.

Ikemen Plus Ultra is an updated version of the OLD Ikemen Plus. The engine was made by Suehiro under S-SIZE Project, improved by K4thos and currently developing by CD2, Strong FS and some features developed by PlasmoidThunder.

if you are intrested in the 32 bit i left a backup for it here [32Bit]([https://github.com](https://github.com/Ahmed-Dzair-Dev/Ikemen-Plus-Ultra-Linux/tree/32bit))

## TODO List

**Ahmed:** Plans for future updates.

- masetring Cmake 

- masetring c++ and c

- learn what is SDL and OpenGL

- Asking Help from AI ✅

- converting those .vcxproj to CMakeLists.txt ✅

------------


**A working linux excutable**  ✅ ( 2025/05/08 )
------------

- find linux alternatives for the unsupported or not working libs ( because " IPU " is a windows project )

" compile the rest of the game engine libs to linux "

the dll folder :

ssz.dll its now libssz.so ( 2025/05/08 )

file.dll its now libfile.so ( 2025/05/08 )

alert.dll its now libalert.so ( 2025/05/08 )

shell.dll to libshell.so ( 2025/05/09 )

time.dll to libtime.so

math.dll its now libmath.so ( 2025/05/08 )

regex.dll its now libregex.so ( 2025/05/08 )

socket.dll to libsocket.so ( 2025/05/09 )

sound.dll to libsound.so 

thread.dll to libthread.so 

the alpha folder :

lua.dll to liblua.so ( planing to find a way to fix it )

( still working in progress )

mesdialog ( not yet )

ogg ( not yet )

sdlplugin ( not yet )

sdlplugin original ( not yet )


- Remplace DirectX with OpenDX or DXVK 

or

- For a general approach to replacing DirectX in the game engine :

Replace DirectX rendering calls with SDL2 rendering

Use SDL2 for window creation and input handling

Use OpenGL for graphics rendering

Ensure Lua scripting remains compatible

- fix bugs

------------

**Add more features**

- Network Play without using Radmin VPN. 

- I will try to find an open source alternative of that program to fuse it with the engine.

- Focusing on performance .

( OpenGl is not friendly with all potato computers. so my interest is on that native directx for linux )

- add more languages like ( arabic , japanese , chinese , "french ?" )

- a char detector ( when the player or the devloper put a new char folder or char.zip " before opening the engine " the engine detects that and it will notfiy us to accept to put the char or not )

------------


i think that it.
