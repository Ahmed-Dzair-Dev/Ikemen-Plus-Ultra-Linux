if I come with someone like you I don't think...

character = ???
text:
Are you implying that I am too young?? well, sorry
bother you, but I'll leave only if you win me a fight!

character = ???
text:
What's wrong with you? I saw you on TV, you don't fight like that.
Maybe did you hold back?

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Nah, I just don't feel very well, I'm looking for someone...

character = ???
text:
Ohh, a while ago I fought with a girl similar to you.
She was also amazing, I want to be like her!

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
!!

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
By chance, that girl you saw has hair red in color, tied as with a gift bow
and 158cm long approximately height?

character = ???

What does he have like blue lines on his suit?

character = Kung Fu Man

Mayama Chan, can you guide me to the last place
where did you see that girl, please?

character = Mako Mayama
text:
Sure... follow me.

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man and Mayama Chan arrive in a lonely valley..

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Hmm, there's no one here...

character = Mako Mayama
text:
Over there!

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Kung Fu Girl!

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Ah!? Kung Fu Man?

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Where have you been all these days!?

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
That... It's not something that concerns you..

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
you believe that?
Tell me, let's go to the temple to talk with calm

character = Mako Mayama
text:
Helloo

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
What about that girl!? Maybe you couldn't stand the loneliness
and you look for a Loli?

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
What!? Noo, I found she a while ago in...

character = 
text:
At that moment, they are attacked by the Suave Dude's Minions
They it had been silent for a couple of weeks.

character = 
text:
While Kung Fu Man, Mayama Chan and Kung Fu Girl
were fighting with the Minions..

character = 
text:
Suave Dude appears..

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Girl is petrified. Kung Fu Man notices and goes to protect her.
However, at that time...

character = Suave Dude
text:
Ohhh my beloved, where have you been all this time!
I was looking for you!

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Since when do you know each other?

character = Suave Dude
text:
Ahh, I know her very well

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Girl no have words, staggers and faints..

character = 
text:
Before Suave Dude can touch Kung Fu Girl.
Kung Fu Man pushes him away with a fast "Kung Fu Palm".

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Kung Fu Girl! What happens?? you are pale!
What did you do to him?

character = Suave Dude
text:
Hmm. She won't listen to you, since she watched my
beauty has been perplexed HAHAHA.

character = Suave Dude
text:
I'm sure she reminds me

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man runs towards Suave Dude and tries to use
his new Kung Fu Crush technique, but it is still incomplete
and he is knocked out by a surprise Triple Kick from Suave Dude..

character = Suave Dude
text:
Ahh yeah, since you messed with my most valuable piece.
I will take your house. Let's see if you can get up after this beating.

character = 
text:
Before Kung Fu Man can get up, the last thing he observes is Suave Dude
kidnaping Kung Fu Girl towards the Mountainside Temple.

character = 
text:
While a large group of Minions begin to pile up and trample Kung Fu Man,
until he is left over totally unconscious...

character = 
text:
...

character = 
text:
...

character = 
text:
Eventually Kung Fu Man regains consciousness and remembers the last happened..

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Damn, that guy didn't just kidnaped my girlfriend.
I neglected the temple too. I'm really out of form..

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
I MEAN, HOW is it possible that a guy like him "Suave" could defeat me!?

character = 
text:
Determined to rescue his Girlfriend. Kung Fu M-

character = Mako Mayama
text:
HEYYY are you forget me!?

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Mayama Chan! This is something I have to figure out for myself.
Really thank you for helping me find Kung Fu Girl.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
But.. I can't allow you to come with me.

character = Mako Mayama
text:
I could be of great help, haven't you asked?
Who took all your henchmen off your back?

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
That's true. Hmm, how do you defeat all of them?
I mean, I don't see them anywhere..

character = Mako Mayama
text:
It does not matter anymore. If what people say is true, then
Suave Dude is the genius who is capable of acquiring powers from
other fighters with a "device" that he himself developed.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Hmm, that's how he knew how to repel my attacks.
SO, He's probably going to want to extract Kung Fu Girl's power.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
But there is something else, they know each other, for some reason
Kung Fu Girl awakened a trauma from her past..

character = Mako Mayama
text:
Well I must return to my home, good luck finding to your girlfriend.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Yeah, thanks! Another day that I carry a pen.
I will give you my autograph.

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man says goodbye to Mako Mayama and now..

character = 
text:
Determined to rescue his Girlfriend..
Kung Fu Man heads to the Mountainside Temple's Hidden Path...

;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Chapter2]

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
That Suave Dude... how is he so confident??
Maybe forced my girlfriend to give him all the plans to cover
all routes and avoid a surprise attack..

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Anyway, I am improving my techniques thanks to getting back into real action.

character = 
text:
At that moment a person identical to Kung Fu Man appears in forehead.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
What the hell do you look like me!?

character = ???
text:
HAHAHA, you are too weak to face me, DIE!

character = 
text:
When threatened, the enemy pulls out a gun, shoots
and Kung Fu Man steps back and hides to think a strategy.

character = 
text:
Until...

[Chapter3A]

character = 
text:
After awaken new skills and defeat his robotic copy.

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man reaches the roof, where he finds Suave Dude.

character = Master Kung Fu Man

Generic character (with his maximum power awakened)
Vs

character = Suave Dude
text:
Who will be the champion!?

;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Chapter3B]

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man is defeated by Evil Kung Fu Man and is taken
to the Mountainside Temple's Roof before Suave Dude..

character = 
text:
When waking up..

character = Suave Dude
text:
Welcome to MY Roof of Truths, the last place you will see
before being replaced!

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man stands up abruptly

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Replaced? YOU CAN NEVER REPLACE KUNG F-

character = 
text:
At that moment, his evil clone uses his robotic arm to
push him towards a wall.

character = Suave Dude
text:
Ah yes, I hadn't told you but...

character = Suave Dude
text:
This imitation that you see is going to take your place.
We will use what is left of your body to complete it.
Isn't that a great job Bioengineering!?

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
How could you replicate my moves in a machine if you don't know me?

character = Suave Dude
text:
Hehe, well I didn't use AI or record them with Evil Kung Fu Man or
a camera the size of a fly either

character = Suave Dude
text:
It was thanks to the data from someone who you knows very well..

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Girl appears

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Wait, how you're not imprisoned in a tower?

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Girl approaches and slaps Kung Fu Man

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Fool! How is it possible that this guy captures me?
and you are not able to rescue me..

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
You are not the Kung Fu Man from that I fell in love.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Well, I just wante-

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Pretend that you wanted to improve your Kung Fu and then
replace me with a child!? It's clear that I was just getting in the way, no.
you were able to recognize my potential..

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
We could have lived together and avoid all this drama.

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Girl, starts to destabilize

character = Suave Dude
text:
Wow, calm down!

character = Suave Dude
text:
Well buddy, it's time to see what are you made
I already have the Band and the laboratory up and running.
Ready to die?

;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Chapter4A]

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
Suave Dude, is over!

character = Suave Dude
text:
Hahaha, I don't think that..
IN FACT! This is just the beginning..
congratulations you have achieved your "Good Ending"!

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
Tell me where you have Kung Fu Girl!

character = Suave Dude
text:
She does not exist, she is an "Illusion" created by me, for
put together an example of our story that will never be finished.

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
Okay, I guess my punches stunned you enough.
So, I will make you suffer until you tell me!

character = Suave Dude
text:
Woah, save that last for another kind of ending buddy.

character = Suave Dude
text:
Ehehehe, I'm sure you want to know why she could imitate your techniques
or how I could build a clone of yours too fast..

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
Speaks!

character = Suave Dude
text:
It's easy... the world where we live is like a micro-matrix..
here it is possible to create any fighter who can copy techniques from others.

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
That's...impossible, she must have some innate talent or something similar,
Otherwise, other fighters like her would have appeared sooner..

character = Suave Dude
text:
Well, you beat me. If you are looking for a Extra Challenge
Take your decision..

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
What do you mean?

character = Suave Dude
text:
I have already complete my purpose and I consider that you too..
but I warn you, this challenge will be the most difficult one
you can face in this story...

character = 
text:
.

;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Chapter4B]

character = Suave Dude
text:
Fascinating, this is a test of your true potential.
However it is useless!

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Do you think this is a game?

character = Suave Dude
text:
In fact it is, that's why our story was never completed.
All this is a simulation, an example of what is possible to tell and create.

character = Suave Dude
text:
Our existence hangs by a thread..
In any moment we will be replaced by characters from other universes/franchises.

character = Suave Dude
text:
The power of this world known as M.U.G.E.N is unlimited,
we must fear human creativity!

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Hey, but this is I.K.E.M.E.N

character = Suave Dude
text:
That makes it much more dangerous lol.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
I don't understand anything that's happening.
Before things were simpler. Why complicate your existence?

character = Suave Dude
text:
Just.. relax man, look, here come the credits.
Are you ready to disappear?

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Aww, I don't want to disappear, please, you who are
watching me, add me to your game.
I don't want my code disappear!

character = 
text:
..

;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Chapter4C]

character = Suave Dude
text:
Haha, I guess your time is over buddy.

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
Damn, what now?

character = Suave Dude
text:
You will have to try again..

character = Suave Dude
text:
what we are left with is just wait for all this temple collapse
due countdown and watch the credits..

character = 
text:
...

;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Chapter4D]

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man falls from the roof and dies brutally hit by soil.

character = Suave Dude
text:
Oh, well I guess they'll have to create someone
stronger than Kung Fu Man who can face us huh?

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
What do you mean by "they"?

character = Suave Dude
text:
Oh, the players of course

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
So this is an example of a Bad Ending?

character = Suave Dude
text:
Yeah, if you lose all the time nothing good can happen..

character = Suave Dude
text:
By the way, we better go down and pick up his body,
because it's going to start to rot...

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Uhgss, do it yourself!

character =
