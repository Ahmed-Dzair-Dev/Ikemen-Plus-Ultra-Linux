character = 
text:
One day, while Kung Fu Man was shopping...

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man crosses paths with a girl
that reminded him of Kung Fu Girl...

character = 
text:
She surprisingly recognizes him immediately.

character = ???
text:
No way, I can't believe it, it's you!!
_
The Legendary Warrior, Kung Fu Man Sama!

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Kung Fu Man is ok..

character = ???
text:
Ohh, I was so excited!!
I always wanted to learn more about Kung Fu in
your Mountainside Temple.

character = ???
text:
Although my financial situation didn't allow it-

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Who are you?

character = ???
text:
I'm your fan!

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Oh, I see..
Well, the temple is closed for the moments.

character = ???
text:
Hey, let's have a fight! I still can't believe it!
are you real?

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Aren't you lost or something? It's just that...
If someone see me with you.. I thin-

character = ???
text:
Are you implying that I'm too young??

character = ???
text:
Well, sorry bother you but.. I'll leave you in peace
only if you fight with me!

character = 
text:
...

character = ???
text:
What's wrong with you? I saw you on TV
You don't fight like that.
Maybe did you hold back?

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Nah, I just don't feel very well.
I'm looking for someone...

character = ???
text:
Ohh.. recently I fought with a girl similar to you.
She was also amazing, I want to be like her!

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
!!

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
By chance, that girl you saw:
has hair red, tied as with a gift bow and..
is approximately 158 cm tall?

character = ???
text:
She have like blue lines on his suit?

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
YES! wait.
I think I have a photo...

character =

character = ???
text:
I'm Mako Mayama. Aspiring Kung Fu Martial Artist.
Is a pleasure!

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Mayama Chan, can you guide me to the last place
where did you see that girl, please?

character = Mako Mayama
text:
Someday I will ever be able to train with you?

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Sure, first I need to fix my life then
I will offer you free lessons by helping me today.

character = Mako Mayama
text:
Ok sounds reasonable.
Let's look for your girlfriend!

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Hey, at no time did I say it was my...

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man and Mayama arrive in a lonely valley..

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Hmm, there's nobody here...

character = Mako Mayama
text:
Over there!

character = 
text:
Mayama points to a bench that is near a hill.
There is a girl sitting looking up at the sky...

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Kung Fu Girl!

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Ah!? Kung Fu Man?

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Where have you been all these days!?

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
That... It's not something that concerns you..

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
you believe that?
Tell me, let's go to the temple to talk with calm.

character = Mako Mayama
text:
Helloo..

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
What about that young girl!?
Maybe you couldn't stand the loneliness
and you look for a Loli!? I will cal-

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
What!? wait Noo, I found she recently in-

character = 
text:
At that moment..
_
They are attacked by Suave Dude's Minions

character = 
text:
They it had been silent for a couple of weeks.

character = 
text:
While Kung Fu Man, Mayama and Kung Fu Girl
were fighting with the Minions..

character = 
text:
Suave Dude appears..

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Girl is petrified.
Kung Fu Man notices and goes to protect her.

character = 
text:
However, at that time...

character = Suave Dude
text:
Ohhh my beloved, where have you been all this time!
I was looking for youu!

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Since when do you know each other?

character = Suave Dude
text:
Ahh, I know her very well..
Each centimeter of her body.

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Girl no have words, staggers and faints..

character = 
text:
Before Suave Dude can touch Kung Fu Girl.
Kung Fu Man pushes him away with a fast
"Kung Fu Palm".

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Kung Fu Girl! What happens?? you're pale!
What did you do to him before?

character = Suave Dude
text:
Hmm. She won't listen to you.

character = Suave Dude
text:
Since she watched my beauty
she has been perplexed HAHAHA.

character = Suave Dude
text:
Now I'm sure, she reminds me!

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man runs towards Suave Dude and tries to use
his new: "Kung Fu Crush" technique.

character = 
text:
But it's still incomplete and he's knocked out by
a surprise "Triple Kick" from Suave Dude..

character = Suave Dude
text:
Ahh yeah

character = Suave Dude
text:
Now that you messed with my most valuable piece.
I will take your temple.
Let's see if you can get up after this beating!!

character = 
text:
Before Kung Fu Man can get up. The last thing he observes is
Suave Dude kidnaping Kung Fu Girl towards Mountainside Temple...

character = 
text:
While a large group of Minions begin to pile up
and trample Kung Fu Man, until he's completely
unconscious...

character = 
text:
...

character = 
text:
. . .

character = 
text:
.     .     .

character = 
text:
Eventually.
Kung Fu Man regains consciousness
and remembers the last happened..

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Damn, that guy didn't just kidnaped my girlfriend.
I neglected the temple too. I'm really out of form..

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
I MEAN.
HOW is possible that a guy like him: "Suave"
could even defeat me!?

character = 
text:
Determined to rescue his Girlfriend. Kung Fu M-

character = Mako Mayama
text:
HEYYY are you forget me!?

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Mayama Chan!
Really, thank you for helping me find Kung Fu Girl.
But this is something I have to solve myself.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Soo.. I can't allow you to come with me.

character = Mako Mayama
text:
I could be of great help
haven't you asked?
_
Who took all Minions off your back?

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
That's true. Hmm, how do you defeat all of them?
I mean, I don't see them anywhere..

character = Mako Mayama
text:
It.. doesn't matter..
If what people say is true then..

character = Mako Mayama
text:
Suave Dude is the genius who is capable of
acquiring powers from other fighters
with a "device" that he himself developed.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Hmm, that's how he knew how to counter my attack..
SO, he's probably going to want extract
Kung Fu Girl's power?

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
But there is something else.. they know each other.
For some reason Kung Fu Girl awakened a "trauma"
from her past..

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
I need to find out what happened between they long
before I met her.

character = Mako Mayama
text:
Well, I must return to my home.
 
Good luck rescuing your girlfriend!

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Yeah, thanks! Another day that I carry a pen.
I will give you my autograph.

character = Mako Mayama
text:
Don't forget the free classes you promised me!
Otherwise I will kidnap your girlfriend
and invade your temple!!

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Haha, ok ok. I will not forget that.
I promise.

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man says goodbye to Mako Mayama and now..

character = 
text:
Determined to rescue his Girlfriend..
Kung Fu Man heads to
_
Mountainside Temple's Hidden Path...

;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Chapter2]

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
That Suave Dude... how is he so confident??
Maybe forced my girlfriend to give him all
Mountainside Temple's Map, to cover all routes
and avoid a surprise attack..

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Anyway, I'm improving my techniques
thanks to getting back into real action.

character = 
text:
At that moment a person identical to Kung Fu Man
appears in forehead.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
What the hell do you look like me!?

character = ???
text:
HAHAHA, you're too weak to face me, DIE!

character = 
text:
When threatened, the enemy pulls out a gun, shoots
and Kung Fu Man steps back and hides to think
a strategy.

character = 
text:
Until...

;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Chapter3A]

character = 
text:
After awaken new skills and defeat his robotic copy.
Kung Fu Man goes in search of Suave Dude
on the Roof of the Mountainside Temple..

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
I better hurry!
Who knows why what kind of torture
Kung Fu Girl will be going through..

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man reaches the roof
where he finds Suave Dude.

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
Leave my temple and Release Kung Fu Girl!

character = Suave Dude
text:
Alright, let me activate self-destruction
to make this more dramatic.

character = Suave Dude
text:
By the way, she has already been "released"..

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
Wher-

character = Suave Dude
text:
You fell! Hahahaha

character = Suave Dude
text:
NOW! Let's do a show:
_
Generic protagonist (with his maximum power awakened)
Vs
Bad Guy with a countdown and a kidnapped princess!

character = Suave Dude
text:
Ladies and Gentlemen! Our stage is set!
Who will be the champion!?
_
Let the ultimate show BEGIN!

;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Chapter3B]

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man is defeated by Evil Kung Fu Man and
is taken to the Mountainside Temple's Roof
before Suave Dude..

character = 
text:
When waking up..

character = Suave Dude
text:
Welcome to the Roof of Truths.
The last place you will see before being replaced!

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man stands up abruptly

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Replaced? YOU CAN NEVER REPLACE KUNG F-

character = 
text:
At that moment, his evil clone uses his robotic arm
to push him towards a wall.

character = Suave Dude
text:
Ah yes, I hadn't told you but...

character = Suave Dude
text:
This imitation that you see is going to..
take your place!
_
We will use what's left of your body to complete it.
Isn't that a great job Bioengineering!?

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
How could you replicate my moves in a machine?
You don't know who I'm!

character = Suave Dude
text:
Hehe, well I didn't use AI or record them with
your clone or a camera with the size of a fly..

character = Suave Dude
text:
It was thanks to the data from someone
who you knows very well..

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Girl appears

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Wait, how you're not imprisoned in a "Tower"?

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Girl approaches and slaps Kung Fu Man

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Fool! How is possible that this guy captures me?
and you're not able to rescue me..

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
You're not the Kung Fu Man from that I fell in love.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Well, I just wante-

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Pretend that you wanted to improve your Kung Fu
and then replace me with a little girl!?
_
It's clear that I was just getting in the way, no.
you couldn't recognize my TRUE potential..

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
We could have lived together
and avoid all this drama.

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Girl starts to destabilize

character = Suave Dude
text:
Well buddy, it's time to see what are you made of
I already have the Band and the laboratory running.
_
Ready to die?

;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Chapter4A]

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
Is over Suave Dude!

character = Suave Dude
text:
Hahaha, I don't think that..
IN FACT! This is just the beginning..
_
congratulations you have achieved your "Good Ending"!

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
Tell me where you have Kung Fu Girl!

character = Suave Dude
text:
She doesn't exist, she's an "Illusion" created by me
to make an example of our story
_
(that will never be finished by the way).

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
Okay, I guess my punches stunned you enough.
So, I will make you suffer until you tell me!

character = Suave Dude
text:
Woah! save that last word for another
kind of ending buddy..

character = Suave Dude
text:
Ehehehe, I'm sure you want to know
why she could imitate your techniques or
how I could build a clone of yours too fast..

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
Speaks!

character = Suave Dude
text:
It's easy... the world where we live is like
a "Micro-Matrix".. here it's possible to create
any fighter who can copy techniques from others.

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
That's...impossible, she must have
some innate talent or something similar..

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
Otherwise.
Other fighters like her would have appeared sooner..

character = Suave Dude
text:
Well, you beat me.
If you're looking for a Extra Challenge
Take your decision..

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
What do you mean?

character = Suave Dude
text:
I have already complete my purpose and
I consider that you too..

character = Suave Dude
text:
But I warn you, this challenge will be
"the most difficult one" you can face
in this story...

character = 
text:
.

;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Chapter4B]

character = Suave Dude
text:
Fascinating, this is a test of your true potential.
However it's useless!

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Do you think this is a game?

character = Suave Dude
text:
In fact it's.

character = Suave Dude
text:
That's why our story was never completed.
All this is a simulation
an example of what's possible to tell and create!

character = Suave Dude
text:
Our existence hangs by a thread..
In any moment we will be replaced
by characters from other universes/franchises.

character = Suave Dude
text:
The power of this world known as M.U.G.E.N
is unlimited.
_
We must fear human creativity!

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Hey but this is I.K.E.M.E.N isn't it?

character = Suave Dude
text:
That makes it much more dangerous lol.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
I don't understand anything that's happening.
_
Before things were simpler.
_
Why complicate your existence?

character = Suave Dude
text:
Just.. relax man. It's all about evolution.
_
Look!, here come the credits.
Are you ready to disappear?

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Aww, I don't want to disappear. Please!
YOU the one who is looking me, add me to your game!!
_
I don't want my code disappear! :u

character = 
text:
..

;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Chapter4C]

character = Suave Dude
text:
Haha, I guess your time is over buddy.

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
Damn, what now?

character = Suave Dude
text:
You will have to try again..

character = Suave Dude
text:
what we're left with is just
wait for all this temple collapse
due countdown and watch the credits..

character = 
text:
...

;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Chapter4D]

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man falls from the roof
and dies brutally hit by soil.

character = Suave Dude
text:
Oh, well I guess they'll have to create someone
stronger than Kung Fu Man who can face us huh?

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
What do you mean by "they"?

character = Suave Dude
text:
Oh, the players of course

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
So this is an example of a Bad Ending?

character = Suave Dude
text:
Yeah, if you lose all the time
nothing good can happen..

character = Suave Dude
text:
By the way, we better go down and pick up his body
because it's going to start to rot...

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Uhgss, do it yourself!

character = 
text:
....
