to take Suave Dude by surprise...

;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Chapter2]

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Wow, there were Suave Dude's Minions in the Hidden Path, maybe
he forced my Girlfriend to give him the entire Mountainside Temple Map
to cover all routes to avoid an attack surprise.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Either way, I'm improving my techniques thanks to real action...

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Come on Suave Dude.. I know where you're hiding, come out at once!

character =

At that moment a person identical to Kung Fu Man appears in
forehead.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
What the hell, who are you!?

character = ???

Upon threatening him, that Kung Fu Man clone
pulls out a gun, and start shooting

on the rooftops of Mountainside Temple.

When Kung Fu Man reaches The Roof.

character = Kung Fu Man

Suave Dude! Leave my temple and let free my student.

character = Suave Dude
text:
Damn!, so you beat the robot. Well, it doesn't matter.
I will finish you here and now! But I don't know which student
you're talking about...

character = ???
text:
So you did know!?

character = 
text:
Suave Dude and Kung Fu Man turn around.

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man's Girlfriend changes into her Kung Fu clothes.

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Did you always know that I was your student?

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Yeah, at first I had my doubts, but that smile...
and that "charisma" that you have, no one can replace it.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
That's why I took it as a second chance to show my love to you
and Kung Fu.

character = Suave Dude
text:
What does this mean miss? We had a deal!

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
I know what I did was reckless, but I wanted to know
if really during the time we were apart. You could improve your Kung Fu,
to defeat your own reflection and rescue your damsel in distress.

character = Suave Dude
text:
AHG, how I repudiate these typical scenes. Since this temple has only
brought me more than problems, so let them die all.

character = 
text:
Suave Dude activates the Mountainside Temple's self-destruct.

character = Suave Dude
text:
Minions, knock them out and let them burn with this temple!

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
I'll go for Suave Dude to disable the self-destruct
you neutralize the Minions!

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Ok Sensei, it's time to end this theater!


;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Chapter3B]

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man is struck down by Evil Kung Fu Man and is
taken to the Roof before Suave Dude.

character = 
text:
When waking up:

character = Suave Dude
text:
Welcome to the Roof of Truths!
The last place you will see before being replaced..

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Replaced?

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man stands up abruptly but at that moment, his Evil clone
uses his robotic arm to push him into a wall.

character = Suave Dude
text:
Ah yes, I hadn't told you but...

character = Suave Dude
text:
This imitation that you see is going to take your place.
We will use what is left of your body to complete it.
Isn't that a great job Bioengineering!?

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
How could you replicate my moves in a machine if you don't know me?

character = Suave Dude
text:
Hehe, well I didn't use AI or record them with Evil Kung Fu Man or
a camera the size of a fly either;
It was thanks to someone who you knows very well..

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Girl appears

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Impossible, where were you all this time?

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
I was always here...

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
What? Well, I just wanted...

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Pretend that you wanted to improve your Kung Fu and then
forget about me with another woman!?

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
It's clear that I was just getting in your way.
You were not able to recognize my potential, we could have lived
together and avoid all this drama.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
NO, wait!

character = Suave Dude
text:
Well friend, it's time to see what you're made of,
I already have the Band and the laboratory up and running.
Ready for die?

;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Chapter4A]

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man and Kung Fu Girl manage to stop Suave Dude
and his Minions in time before the countdown reach zero.

character = 
text:
After checking that Suave Dude is knocked out:

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Follow me sensei, I think I know where the generator
that Suave Dude installed is.

character = 
text:
While they both run down the hallway:

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
why Suave Dude wanted put a self-destruct system in the temple?

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
I mean, didn't he want to take this place?

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Later we need to discuss what happened well, but in short.
Suave Dude wanted to start a supercomputer
to mine cryptocurrencies..

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Then Mountainside Temple was going served as
its base of illegitimate operations...

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
However, if you managed to cause him trouble
he would have a plan B which consisted of killing you
along with the evidence of his illegal operations.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
AND YOU SUPPORTED ALL THAT?

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
No! I mean.. actually..
I just wanted to hurt you in a sentimental way

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
"letting myself be kidnapped", but my intention went too far

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
When I found out what he really wanted to
he took advantage of my plan to set up his own.

character = 
text:
Both reach the generator and deactivate the self-destruct system.

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
I was a fool to trust that a "Ricachon" would fulfill my wish
without seeking something in return.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Well.. You

character = 
text:
At that time, Evil Kung Fu Man who was supposedly destroyed
is activated to go in search of Suave Dude.

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Girl and Kung Fu Man end up destroying it
with an dual special attack.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
HA, nothing like mastered Kung Fu.

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
You said it haha, and now...

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
What are we left with that day?

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Hmm. First we have to deliver Suave Dude to the police..

character = 
text:
Weeks after the incident..

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man finds Kung Fu Girl training in a park

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
This is wonderfull! I missed going back too much train with you sensei.

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
Yeah, same here

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
That time you were walking dressed up I didn't feel so comfortable.
But let's keep looking forward the future instead of worrying about the past.

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
We must get stronger, don't you know?

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Soon we will receive new guests to train in the
temple for the inevitable Multiversal Tournament.

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
Oh, the canonical event that occurs every certain centuries
I have also been training to represent my clan there.

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Best of all, I made some friends during
my journey of self-exploration and they taught me
new ways to exponentially increase my skills!

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
Are you implying that you have surpassed me? Well I see that
You didn't completely waste your time with that bully.

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
Then show me your full potential like in the old days!

;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Chapter4B]

character = 
text:
After a furious battle, Kung Fu Man manages to defeat all.
However..

character = Suave Dude
text:
Ahahahaha, YES THAT'S IT! I can FEEL your anger Man.
Just look at your boyfriend girl

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
And is this Kung Fu for you Kung Fu Man? Becau-

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
ENOUGH! You deceived me and in the process you allied yourself with
this ruffian to invade my temple! What the hell were you on thought-out?

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Ahh, you already understand what it feels like to be abandoned
your luck eh? Although I didn't know that all this time you knew that
It was really me...

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
I didn't abandon you, I just told you to go look more strength
by taking time for yourself, that was going to help me also to improve.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
You could return at any time, but I SEE that you wasted it
THEY EVEN CLONED ME! Did you want to get rid of me completely?

character = Suave Dude
text:
JO! It gets better if I tell you that she taught me
all those techniques with I confronted you.

character = Suave Dude
text:
Although go trash, because they were of no use to me.

character = 
text:
A furious Kung Fu Man runs and hits hard at Kung Fu Girl
she tries to defend herself.. but not having enough force
after the previous combat

character = 
text:
she slips and is hanging from the Roof about to fall..

character = Suave Dude
text:
Evil Kung Fu Man, activates the self-destruct of the Temple!

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
OH I DON'T BELIEVE IT!

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man runs to prevent his clone from destroying the
temple, but at that moment..

character = 
text:
With the little strength he had left
Kung Fu Girl lets out a cry of despair.

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Sensei! I can't ho-ld!

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man goes crazy to maintain his temple,
leaving him deaf and blind to his other priority.

character = 
text:
So destroy everything was left of Evil Kung Fu Man
but then he hears the screams of Kung Fu Girl falling from the Roof.

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
KYAAAhh!

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man runs, but it is impossible to hold his hand again.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
NOOOOOOOOOO, damn!!!

character = Suave Dude
text:
Ahahahaha, you saved the temple, well done, but what cost?
HA HA HA HA HAA

character = Suave Dude
text:
I honestly wanted to see how you both burned alive
buttt I guess it was all over for me.

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man doesn't say anything, he stands on the edge of the roof looking
to the ground the gutted body of the girl..

character = Suave Dude
text:
Man tell me something! You broke my ribs and I am no will be able
to appreciate the girl's corpse. But cheer up!

character = Suave Dude
text:
What do you think about have a party at your temple by unmarried farewell?

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man turns around and picks up Suave Dude from the floor.

character = 
text:
Then, he throws him into the air and hits him with a
Smash Kung Fu Upper.

character = 
text:
Before he falls remember Evil Kung Fu Man's grip on him
he did before and retorts it with anger in his eyes.

character = 
text:
Finally, he focuses all his anger on the new technique he has
been perfecting, but now it has been distorted:
Kung Fu Crush.

character = 
text:
Lightning strikes Suave Dude's body as he flies away
from the roof from that brutal blow.

character = 
text:
The last thing you heard is a heartbreaking scream coming from the
Mountainside Temple Roof and a wave of Minions approaching to avenge
their leader, while the rain falls on the long and dark night...

;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Chapter4C]

character = 
text:
The fight has reached its climax..

character = 
text:
There are bodies of Minions scattered throughout the room.

character = 
text:
Suave Dude can barely stand and both Kung Fu Man and Kung Fu Girl
are exhausted after using their maximum power.

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
The countdown almost reaches zero,
We have to leave the temple!

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Everything you've worked for will disappear..

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
I think know where the generator is with the explosives

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
There is still a way to reach and stop the self-destruction..
I'll use my new speed technique to catch up.

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
Don't do it! It's too dangerous

character = Suave Dude
text:
Agh, ehehe, ahahaha

character = Suave Dude
text:

character = Suave Dude
text:
Ahg. I'm going to see you burn likeee a chicken
in a matter of seconds GAHg.

character = Suave Dude
text:
I have been able endure thanks to the techniques
that your friend taught me.

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
Suave Dude! I'll g-

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
NO! This is my mistake, I caused all this, now
I must fix it at any cost.

character = Master Kung Fu Man
text:
In fact, if I hadn't told you it that day
I don't think this would have happened...

character = 
text:
In the blink of an eye and without a last word
Kung Fu Girl uses dizzying speed to go stop the
self destruction.

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man realizes it within seconds and runs after her,
letting an injured Suave Dude escape...

character = 
text:
In the corridor, Kung Fu Man finds the remains of Evil Kung Fu Man
who activates and stops him pushing it with its robust robotic arm
until it is out of the temple...

character = 
text:
Evil Kung Fu Man emits one last laugh
that will stay for always in Kung Fu Man's head.

character = 
text:
The last thing heard is a big explosion in the
Mountainside Temple, as well as the desperate cry
of a Master Kung Fu who has lost someone he can never get back...

character = 
text:
Perhaps, that man jumped to that hasty conclusion
because the authorities never found Kung Fu Girl's body...

;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Chapter4D]

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man falls brutally from the roof.

character = 
text:
The sound of broken bones echoes through that place

character = 
text:
After a few minutes the rainy stops..

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Girl, Suave Dude and Evil Kung Fu Man go down
to the playground and approach Kung Fu's body Man.

character = 
text:
They find that man with a suffering face.
a face of indescribable pain, with red tears..

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
I... I was wrong, I didn't know how to handle things
so I decided get rid of my feelings for you.
When I finally could find the balance you were no longer there
and I met her...

character = Suave Dude
text:
Man.. you really are blind, you student..
she was always the Girlfriend I kidnapped.

character = Suave Dude
text:
I found her crying that day that you told him to leave your temple.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Agh.. gs. n-o waay
Kung Fu Girl... why?, why did you help Suave Dude?
why did you lie to me?

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Suave Dude and I had common goals.
Taking away everything you had, that meant making you feel loved.
Just like you once made me feel...

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Now you don't have nothing left, even a robot will replace you.

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
So now you can leave this world LOOSERR

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Bye Bye Kung Fu Man.

character = 
text:
After having spilled a lot of blood
Kung Fu Man begins to see everything blurry
can no longer speak, only hear his pathetic destiny..

character = Suave Dude
text:
We will burn the body along with what remains of the
temple to then rebuild our new empire from this area.

character = Suave Dude
text:
Now come with me and I will put the whole village at your feet
my master girl.

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Man loses consciousness...
