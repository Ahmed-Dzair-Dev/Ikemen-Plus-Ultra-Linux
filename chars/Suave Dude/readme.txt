Suave Dude (Last update 2010/10/07)
---------------------------------------------
After years of silence, the elusive Suave Dude finally appears! It seems that Suave's gun was mostly for show however, as he instead opts to fight with a kick-oriented playstyle, perhaps to be on a more even playing field with his arch-nemesis.


The character "Suave Dude" that appears in the opening of Kung Fu Man,
I made it based on my own imagination.
Of course, it is not his official Elecbyte. note that.
