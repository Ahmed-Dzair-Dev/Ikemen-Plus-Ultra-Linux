=====<MOVE DETAILS>=====

 - Zugai Hasatsu is an overhead

 - Tenma Kuujin Kyaku must be performed at the apex of a forward jump

 - You can cancel crouching fierce with a jump to start an Aerial Rave

 - You can adjust the trajectory of Messatsu Gou Rasen and Messatsu Gou Senpuu by holding forward or backward

 - Tenshou Kaireki Jin can be performed during Ashura Senkuu



=====<GAMEPLAY NOTES>=====

COMBO SYSTEM
 - Normal attacks can be chained in this order: X, A, Y, B, Z, C
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Super moves can be canceled into other Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points


DAMAGE SCALING
 - The damage your attacks inflict goes down as the total combo damage goes up
 - At 0 combo damage, they deal full damage
 - At 500 combo damage, they deal the minimum 10% damage


COUNTER HITS
 - If the opponent is in the middle of attacking, your attacks deal 20% extra damage
 - Normal attacks cause extra hit stun as well, allowing links that are normally not possible
 - You'll know a counter hit happened when a round shockwave effect appears at the point of impact


FORWARD DASH
 - Moves you forward faster than walking, but you can't interrupt it
 - Useful for sneaking up on the opponent


RUN
 - Can be interrupted unlike dashes


BACK DASH
 - Creates some space between you and the opponent
 - Considered airborne, so it avoids most throws and standing combos


LOW JUMP
 - Useful for quick jumping attacks that must be blocked high
 - Cannot use special and super moves while low jumping
 - Delay after attacking is longer than other jumps


HIGH JUMP
 - Useful for quickly closing distance
 - If the opponent is in the corner, this allows you to cross him up


LONG LOW JUMP
 - A cross between Low and High jumps


SIDESTEP
 - Avoids all attacks and fireballs
 - Vulnerable to throws
 - Instant recovery


SIDESTEP ATTACK
 - Allows you to counterattack after dodging
 - Between the punch and kick options, one can be cancelled into special and super moves, and the other knocks down


ROLL
 - Avoids all attacks and fireballs while moving
 - Vulnerable to throws
 - Can be hit by anything at the end of the animation
 - Forward version is a bit faster than the back version


PARRY
 - Allows you to bypass block stun, leaving the opponent open for a counterattack
 - To parry high attacks tap forward just before being hit. To parry low attacks tap down. While jumping only forward works


POWER CHARGE
 - Manually charges the power meter
 - Rate of charge is slow at first, but increases the longer you hold it


GUARD CANCEL
 - While guarding, this cancels out of the guarding pose with a counterattack
 - Useful to relieve pressure


CUSTOM COMBO
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start


FALL RECOVERY
 - Allows you to land on your feet after being knocked down


ROLL RECOVERY
 - Allows you to sneak up behind the opponent after being knocked down
 - Completely vulnerable to throws and low attacks
 - Holding forward makes you travel farther



=====<OTHER INFO>=====

<Selecting the win pose>

X or A -> Gouki does his horse stance;
Y or B -> Gouki turns his back and says one of two possible speeches: "Shoushi!" (Ridiculous!)
or "Haji to shirei!" (You're a disgrace!);
Z or C -> Gouki stomps the ground, surrounded by an aura and making the whole screen shake
while saying "Orokana!" (You fool!).


<Extra win poses>

Win by Misogi -> Gouki turns his back and says "Shoushi!" (Ridiculous!);
Win by Shun Goku Satsu -> Gouki has his back turned with his kanji glowing, says "I am the
Master of the Fist!" and a special background appears.
