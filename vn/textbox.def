Kung Fu Man's Girlfriend changes into her Kung Fu clothes.

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Did you always know that I was your student?

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Yeah, at first I had my doubts, but that smile...
and that "charisma" that you have, no one can replace it.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
That's why I took it as a second chance to show my love to you
and Kung Fu.

character = Suave Dude
text:
What does this mean miss? We had a deal!

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
I know what I did was reckless, but I wanted to know
if really during the time we were apart. You could improve your Kung Fu,
to defeat your own reflection and rescue your damsel in distress.

character = Suave Dude
text:
AHG, how I repudiate these typical scenes. Since this temple has only
brought me more than problems, so let them die all.

text:
Minions, knock them out and let them burn with this temple!

character = Kung Fu Man

you neutralize the Minions!

text:

uses his robotic arm to push him into a wall.

character = Suave Dude
text:
Ah yes, I hadn't told you but...

character = Suave Dude
text:
This imitation that you see is going to take your place.
We will use what is left of your body to complete it.
Isn't that a great job Bioengineering!?

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
How could you replicate my moves in a machine if you don't know me?

character = Suave Dude
text:
Hehe, well I didn't use AI or record them with Evil Kung Fu Man or
a camera the size of a fly either;
It was thanks to someone who you knows very well..

character = 
text:
Kung Fu Girl appears

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
Impossible, where were you all this time?

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
I was always here...

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
What? Well, I just wanted...

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
Pretend that you wanted to improve your Kung Fu and then
forget about me with another woman!?

character = Kung Fu Girl
text:
It's clear that I was just getting in your way.
You were not able to recognize my potential, we could have lived
together and avoid all this drama.

character = Kung Fu Man
text:
NO, wait!

character = Suave Dude
text:
Well friend, it's time to see what you're made of,
I already have the Band and the laboratory up and running.
Ready for die?
